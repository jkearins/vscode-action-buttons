# VSCode Action Buttons Ext

The VS Code extension adds buttons to status bar. The buttons can be used to execute custom commands in Terminal or to activate any VS Code command just like keyboard shortcuts do. The extension has adaptation for esp-idf framework.

## Thanks

The extension is inspired by [vscode-action-buttons](https://github.com/seunlanlege/vscode-action-buttons) extension created by *Seun Lanlege*, maintains compatibility and expands functionality.

## Basic features

* Executing commands in terminal.
* Predefined vars like `${file}` can be used in commands for terminal.
* Executing VS Code commands.
  * Any command that can be activated via a keyboard shortcut can be activated via a button.
* Ability to customize text color for a buttons.
* Iconized buttons.
  * Icons can be added to buttons by using the Markdown icons-in-labels syntax. For example, to add an alert icon you include `$(alert)` in the button name. See https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels for more info.

## 🔥 Extended features

> The main feature for which the new version of the extension was created is an ability to run commands in the same terminal, regardless of which button they are generated by.

* Commands can be executed in any allready opened terminal without creating a new one.
  * Define the terminal name in command option, so that the command will be executed in the existing terminal. If a terminal with that name does not exist it will be created.
* A button can send one or more commands to a terminal.
* Builtin command `clear` before the custom command is now conditional.
* User defined config options can be used in commands for terminal.
  * Use these variables in form like `${var}`.

## Installation and setup

 - [x] Install the `VSCode Action Buttons` extension in your VS Code instance.
 - [x] After installing, open your VS Code settings (`Ctrl+,`). Navigate to the `Extensions` section then to the `VSCode Action Buttons` subsection (at the end or almost at the end of list).
 - [x] Press `Edit in settings.json` and define the action buttons you want. Below is a sample configuration for reference. See [Config Options](#config-options) for a list of valid options for each command.
 - [x] Reload the VS Code window to see the new buttons. Alternatively, you can run the `Refresh Action Buttons` command to refresh without reloading the window.

## Command Options

* **name**
    * Name of the action button. This field is required.
* **command**
    * Command to execute when action is activated. This field is required.
	* If `useVsCodeApi` is `true`, this is the VS Code command to execute. Otherwise, this specifies the command to execute in the terminal.

    * Tooltip text to display when hovering over the button. Defaults to `command`.
* **cwd**
    * Start directory when executing terminal command. Defaults to `${workspaceFolder}`. Only valid when `useVsCodeApi` is `false`.
    * If `ignoreCwd` is `true`, the terminal does not receive `cmd` nor `${workspaceFolder}` as start directory and opens in its own start directory.
* **singleInstance**
    * Reopen associated terminal each time this action is activated. Defaults to `false`. Only valid when `useVsCodeApi` is `false`.
* **focus**

* 🔥 **ignoreClear**
    * Specifies whether to send builtin `clear` command to the terminal before the user defined `command`. Defaults to `false` that means builtin `clear` is sent before the user defined `command`.

As seen in the previous example, vars such as `${file}` can be used. Below is a list of each of them and what they do.

* `workspaceFolder` - the path of the folder opened in VS Code.
* `workspaceFolderBasename` - the name of the folder opened in VS Code without any slashes (/).
* `file` - the current opened file.
* `relativeFile` - the current opened file relative to workspaceFolder.
* `fileBasename` - the current opened file's basename.
